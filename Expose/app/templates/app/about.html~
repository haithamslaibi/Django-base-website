	<h2 class="blog-post-tittle">What do we do</h2>
	<p class = "lead blog-description">
We noticed that in our region, Israelis and Palestinians consume different news sources, which give a one-sided presentation of current events ,because of lack of exposure to each other, we have created a website built on peopleâ€™s opinions, which shows two articles from different perspectives (Israeli and Palestinian), and gives people a stage to debate.
